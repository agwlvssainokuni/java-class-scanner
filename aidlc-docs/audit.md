# AI-DLC Audit Log

## Workspace Detection
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-05T15:08:58Z
**User Input**: "本プロジェクトの開発プロセスとしてAI-DLCを導入します。"
**AI Response**: "Displayed AI-DLC welcome message. Loaded common rules (process-overview.md, session-continuity.md, content-validation.md, question-format-guide.md) and extension opt-in prompts (security-baseline, resiliency-baseline, property-based-testing) from .aidlc-rule-details/. Executed Workspace Detection: no aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md found (new AI-DLC project). Scanned workspace: existing Java/Gradle codebase found (src/main/java/cherry/classscanner/{Main.java, ClassScannerRunner.java}, build.gradle, settings.gradle) -> classified as Brownfield. No existing reverse-engineering artifacts found under aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/. Created aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md. Determined next phase: Reverse Engineering."
**Context**: INCEPTION PHASE - Workspace Detection (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

## Reverse Engineering
**Timestamp**: 2026-08-05T15:11:56Z
**User Input**: (continuation of "本プロジェクトの開発プロセスとしてAI-DLCを導入します。" - no new user input during this stage)
**AI Response**: "Executed Reverse Engineering per .aidlc-rule-details/inception/reverse-engineering.md: analyzed src/main/java/cherry/classscanner/{Main.java, ClassScannerRunner.java}, application.properties, build.gradle, settings.gradle, gradle-wrapper.properties, README.md/README_en.md, and git log. Generated 8 artifacts + timestamp file under aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/ (business-overview.md, architecture.md, code-structure.md, api-documentation.md, component-inventory.md, technology-stack.md, dependencies.md, code-quality-assessment.md, reverse-engineering-timestamp.md). Updated aidlc-state.md with Reverse Engineering Status. Presented completion message to user requesting review/approval before proceeding to Requirements Analysis."
**Context**: INCEPTION PHASE - Reverse Engineering (CONDITIONAL - Brownfield Only)
